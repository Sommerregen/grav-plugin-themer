## About

With `Themer` you will get the freedom to change the theme by setting the `theme` variable in the header of a page or collection:

```yaml
theme: my-theme
```

Theme variables are being inherited from parent pages. Thus without any doing, pages from collections are automatically styled with the same theme. Further you have the possibility to reset the theme to the default value (defined in the `system.yaml` configuration) by finally using the command

```yaml
theme: @default
```

## Installation and Updates

Installing or updating the `Themer` plugin can be done in one of two ways. Using the GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation update method or (i.e. `bin/gpm install themer`) manual install by downloading [this plugin](https://github.com/sommerregen/grav-plugin-themer) and extracting all plugin files to

    user/plugins/themer

For more informations, please check the [Installation and update guide](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Usage

The `Themer` plugin comes with some sensible default configuration, that are pretty self explanatory:

### Config Defaults

```yaml
# Global plugin configurations

enabled: true               # Set to false to disable this plugin completely
```

If you need to change any value, then the best process is to copy the [themer.yaml](themer.yaml) file into your `users/config/plugins/` folder (create it if it doesn't exist), and then modify there. This will override the default settings.

If you want to alter the settings for one or a few pages only, you can do so by adding page specific configurations into your page headers, e.g.

```yaml
themer: false
```

to disable the `Themer` plugin just for this page,

```yaml
theme: my-theme
```

to assign an individual theme to the page or collection or

```yaml
theme: @default
```

to reset the theme variable and fall back to the default theme defined in the `system.yaml` configuration.
